Ensure the current state is saved (Codespaces)
A. Save your files (the easy part)

In Codespaces/VS Code (browser):

Press Ctrl + S on any open file you edited

Or use File → Save All

That saves files to the Codespace disk — not to GitHub yet.

B. Make sure nothing is “unsaved” or “untracked”

git remote -v

output should be like this 

origin  https://github.com/srajagopalan1204/son_e_lum (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/srajagopalan1204/son_e_lum (push)

Open the Source Control panel (left sidebar icon that looks like a branch), or use terminal:

git status

You’ll see one of these situations:

“nothing to commit, working tree clean” → you’re good (everything already committed)

files listed under “Changes not staged” → you edited files but haven’t committed

files listed under “Untracked files” → new files not added to git yet

C. Commit your changes (this is the real “save point”)

Run these three commands:

git add -A
git commit -m "WIP savepoint 20260301_0830"
git push

What this does:

add -A = include all changes (new/edited/deleted)

commit = creates a restore point

push = copies it to GitHub (so even if Codespace dies, you’re safe)

✅ After that, verify:

git status
results like this 
git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
You want: working tree clean

2) Full backup of the repository (two solid methods)
Method 1 (best): Make a “mirror” backup (includes all branches + tags)

This creates a single backup folder that has everything git knows.

Go to a folder where you want backups (in Codespaces):

cd ~
mkdir -p backups
cd backups

Create a mirror clone (replace with your repo URL):
need the data collected around line 19 

git clone --mirror https://github.com/srajagopalan1204/SOP_Stage.git

result of 2026 03 01 run

Cloning into bare repository 'SOP_Stage.git'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 514, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Total 514 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0), pack-reused 509 (from 1)
Receiving objects: 100% (514/514), 53.22 MiB | 44.42 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (118/118), done.
ls

That will create a folder like:
SOP_Stage.git

Zip it (so it’s one file):

tar -czf SOP_Stage_mirror_20260301_0830.tar.gz SOP_Stage.git
ls
SOP_Stage.git  SOP_Stage_mirror_20260301_0830.tar.gz
✅ You now have a “full git backup” tarball.

mv to root of repo and download to external drive 

mv SOP_Stage_mirror_20260301_0830.tar.gz /workspaces/SOP_Stage/
/

cd /workspaces/SOP_Stage
Restore later (anywhere):

tar -xzf <YOUR_REPO>_mirror_20260301_0830.tar.gz
git clone <YOUR_REPO>.git restored_repo
Method 2: Backup the repo plus all working files (even if not committed)

This is useful if you want a snapshot of the whole folder exactly as it sits.

Go to your repo folder (example):

cd /workspaces/<YOUR_REPO>

Make a tarball of the whole directory:

cd ..
tar -czf <YOUR_REPO>_WORKSPACE_20260301_0830.tar.gz <YOUR_REPO>

This includes:

your code

configs

scripts

outputs (unless excluded)

and the .git folder (so history too)

Note: If your repo has huge output folders, the file can get very big.

Quick “do this every time” mini-checklist

Save files: Ctrl+S

Check changes:

git status

Commit + push:

git add -A
git commit -m "WIP savepoint YYYYMMDD_HHMM"
git push

Monthly/weekly full backup (pick one):

Mirror backup (best)

Workspace tarball (most literal)
